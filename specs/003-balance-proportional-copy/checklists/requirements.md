# Specification Quality Checklist: Balance-Proportional Position Copying

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Validation Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in business language focusing on user needs. No mention of specific technologies (only Hyperliquid platform as business context, not implementation detail).

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All assumptions documented in Assumptions section.

3. **Success Criteria**: All 7 success criteria are measurable, technology-agnostic, and verifiable:
   - SC-001 to SC-007 all include specific metrics (time, percentage, count)
   - No implementation details (e.g., "users can copy positions in under 10 seconds" not "API response time < 100ms")

4. **User Scenarios**: 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P3) with clear independent test criteria and acceptance scenarios. Primary flows covered for MVP (P1), preview/confirmation (P2), and future enhancement (P3).

5. **Edge Cases**: 6 specific edge cases identified covering balance insufficiency, market availability, execution failures, and timing issues.

6. **Scope**: Clearly bounded with assumptions about existing infrastructure (copy trading system, API key configuration) and specific constraints (Hyperliquid $12 minimum trade size).

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No issues identified that require spec updates
- All quality gates passed on first iteration
