# Specification Quality Checklist: Signal Collection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All items complete

**Content Quality Review**:
- ✅ Spec focuses on WHAT and WHY without implementation details
- ✅ All requirements are business-focused (bot registration, signal collection, parsing)
- ✅ Written in plain language understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness Review**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- ✅ All 20 functional requirements are testable and specific
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (90% accuracy, 5 seconds storage time, 24-hour uptime)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation language (no mention of TypeScript, Prisma, grammY, etc.)
- ✅ All 3 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios (5, 4, and 8 scenarios respectively)
- ✅ Edge cases cover message format variations, connection failures, database unavailability, and data integrity
- ✅ Scope clearly defined: Phase 1 signal collection only, excludes price tracking and P&L calculation
- ✅ Assumptions documented: group access, signal format patterns, database schema exists

**Feature Readiness Review**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ Three user stories cover the complete MVP workflow: connection → detection → parsing/storage
- ✅ All success criteria are measurable: percentages, time limits, and uptime targets specified
- ✅ Specification remains technology-agnostic throughout

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All 3 user stories are P1 priority, aligning with MVP-first constitution
- Zero clarifications needed - spec makes informed guesses based on domain knowledge
- Edge cases provide clear guidance for implementation without being prescriptive
