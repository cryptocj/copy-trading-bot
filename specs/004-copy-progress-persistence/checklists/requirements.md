# Specification Quality Checklist: Copy Trading Progress Persistence

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Clarification Resolved**:
- FR-007: User chose Option C (Never expire - manual only)
- Updated to: "System MUST keep persisted sessions in storage indefinitely until user manually clears them"

**Quality Assessment**:

1. **Content Quality**: ✅ PASSED - Specification focuses on business value (preventing session loss) without mentioning specific technologies except where necessary as context (browser storage type, WebSocket)

2. **Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASSED - All 12 requirements testable and unambiguous. FR-007 clarified with user input.

3. **Success Criteria**: ✅ PASSED - All 7 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "resume within 5 seconds" not "localStorage access time < 50ms")

4. **User Scenarios**: ✅ PASSED - 3 independently testable stories covering automatic recovery (P1), status visibility (P2), and configuration persistence (P3)

5. **Edge Cases**: ✅ PASSED - 7 specific edge cases identified including multi-tab conflicts, invalid API keys, corrupted state, and version mismatches

6. **Assumptions**: ✅ PASSED - Mentions "browser storage" as architectural context, not implementation prescription. Clearly states session recovery is browser/device-local and sessions never expire automatically.

## Notes

- Specification ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No issues identified that require spec updates
- All quality gates passed after user clarification
