# Specification Quality Checklist: Hyperliquid Copy Trading

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - spec focuses on user needs and outcomes
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - all user stories articulate clear value proposition
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - avoids technical jargon, uses plain language
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, and Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - all requirements are fully specified
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - each FR can be verified through testing
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - all SC include specific metrics (time, percentage, behavior)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - no mention of frameworks, languages, or implementation details
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - each user story has 3 Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - 7 MVP-critical edge cases documented with expected behaviors
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Out of Scope section lists 10 MVP exclusions
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - 4 dependencies (including leaderboard API) and 7 assumptions clearly stated

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 23 FRs organized by user story, each specifies MUST behaviors
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 4 user stories (P1-P2) covering discovery, setup, auto-copy, and observability
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - 8 success criteria with specific time/percentage targets
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - spec maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- [x] MVP focus maintained - trader discovery as entry point, core copy trading functionality, minimal observability

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All checklist items complete

**Detailed Review**:

1. **MVP Focus with Discovery**: Spec includes 4 user stories starting with trader discovery as the entry point. This follows natural user flow: discover traders → configure → copy → monitor.

2. **Trader Discovery as US1**: Leaderboard integration moved from "optional enhancements" to core MVP. Users can browse top 20 traders and select one to copy, eliminating the need to manually find wallet addresses.

3. **Functional Requirements**: 23 FRs organized by user story:
   - US1 (Discovery): 5 FRs for leaderboard fetch, display, and trader selection
   - US2 (Configuration): 6 FRs for validation and control
   - US3 (Auto-Copy): 6 FRs for monitoring and execution
   - US4 (Observability): 3 FRs for order display
   - Reliability: 3 FRs for error handling

4. **Success Criteria**: 8 measurable criteria including leaderboard load time (SC-001) as the first user interaction metric.

## Notes

- **Story Flow**: US1 (Discover) → US2 (Configure) → US3 (Auto-Copy) → US4 (Monitor) - logical user journey
- **Dependencies Updated**: Added leaderboard API endpoint as first dependency
- **Edge Cases**: Added leaderboard API unavailable scenario with manual entry fallback
- **Key Entities**: Added "Leaderboard Trader" entity with address, ROI, PnL fields
- **Future Enhancements**: Removed "trader discovery" (now MVP), kept vault discovery for future

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` to begin implementation planning phase
